/*************************************************************************
 * OVERVIEW OF USAGE
 *
 * Digital signatures use a generic DigSig plugin supplied by Adobe, and one 
 * or more specific method plugins supplied by Adobe and third parties. This 
 * file defines the interface between DigSig and a specific method plugin, 
 * XxxxSig. 
 *
 * Note that enriched support for public key digital signatures and encryption
 * is available using the PubSecHFT, introduced in Acrobat 6.0.
 * Developers are encouraged to use the PubSecHFT rather then DigSigHFT.
 * The PubSec code uses DigSig for digital signature operations, but provides
 * many additional benefits.
 *
 * The reader is assumed to be familiar with The Acrobat Viewer Plug-in API 
 * Tutorial, Technical Note #5169.
 *
 * Upon startup of Acrobat, there is a 3-step initialization sequence, 
 * consisting of
 *		1) all plugins export HFTs (Host Function tables)
 *		2) all plugins import HFTs
 *		3) all plugins perform initialization
 * This sequence allows plugins to establish communication among themselves 
 * without being dependent on the order of loading. For digital signatures, 
 * the sequence is:
 *
 *		1) DigSig exports its HFT under the name "DigSigHFT"
 *		2)		XxxxSig imports the DigSig HFT
 *				YyyySig imports the DigSig HFT
 *		3)		XxxxSig calls DigSigRegisterFilter to handle signatures of 
 *					type /Xxxx:PPK
 *				YyyySig calls DigSigRegisterFilter to handle signatures of 
 *					type /Yyyy:Finger
 *				These registrations include passing to DigSig a struct of 
 *				callback routines and other information.
 *		...
 * Eventually, the user opens a document.
 *		DigSig calls XxxxSig and YyyySig to notify them of the new document; 
 *		they might allocate some storage or choose to automatically validate 
 *		any of their respective signatures in the document. Note that auto-
 *		validation may encounter significant delays if it requires reading 
 *		the entirety of a large document off a CD-ROM or over a network, or 
 *		it requires accessing some signature registry or authority over a 
 *		network; Adobe software will only access signatures at user request.
 *		4) DigSig calls XxxxSig.docOpen()
 *		   DigSig calls YyyySig.docOpen()
 *
 * If the user creates a signature field and does not specify a default 
 * signing method, DigSig handles that with no communication to the method 
 * plugins. 
 *		DigSig creates the signature field dictionary
 *		DigSig creates the signature annotation dictionary
 *		DigSig creates the (blank) signature appearance dictionary
 *
 * Signaturre fields can also be created by the Forms plugin.
 *
 * If the user deletes a signature field, DigSig handles that with no 
 * communication to the method plugins. 
 *
 * If the user creates a signature field and specifies a default method, that 
 * plugin is called to fill in default values:
 *		DigSig creates the signature field dictionary
 *		DigSig creates the signature annotation dictionary
 *		DigSig creates the (blank) signature appearance dictionary
 *		5) DigSig calls XxxxSig.defaultValue
 *				XxxxSig creates the default signature value dictionary
 *				XxxxSig creates /DV in the signature field dictionary 
 *					pointing to this
 *
 * If the user asks to sign a specific signature field using method XxxxSig,
 * DigSig sequences the interaction. This sequence is now a four-step process 
 * (the routine names are all different so that you can write transitional code 
 * that includes both the old and new style interaction). The new interaction 
 * looks like this:
 *
 *		Call XxxxSig.dsNewSigData			-- Do any dialogs, gather 
 *											   signature, save in memory
 *											   YOU MAY USE THE DV (default value)
 *											   part of sigfield if sigfield is not COSNULL
 *		if !cancel
 *		  Call XxxxSig.dsUnValidateSig on each signature
 *		  Calculate /Changes
 *		  Do save-as dialog for file name and OK/Cancel
 *		  if !cancel
 *		    Call XxxxSig.dsCommitSign		-- Alter document in memory
 *		    if !cancel
 *		      Do any side effects on other fields	
 *		      Insert /Changes				-- Save document on disk
 *		      Do actual save				-- Save document on disk
 *		      if !cancel
 *		        Call XxxxSig.dsFinishSign	-- Update document on disk
 *		Call XxxxSig.dsFreeSigData			-- Free up memory
 *
 *		6a) DigSig calls XxxxSig.dsNewSigData
 *			XxxxSig interacts with the user, and allows Cancel
 *			XxxxSig acquires the signature itself in a method-specific 
 *			way. All information is saved in memory, without altering 
 *			the document itself. This allows a later backout.
 *		6b) If dsNewSigData does not cancel, DigSig prepares the document 
 *			for saving. It first calls dsUnValidateSig on every 
 *			signature in the document to put any over/underprinting in
 *			cannonical form. It then counts how many pages and fields 
 * 			have changed since any prior signature and records this.
 *		6c) For a first signature, DigSig does the save-as dialog, 
 *			allowing the user to select filename, optimization, and 
 *			encryption. Or the user may cancel. Other than fatal errors
 *			such as out-of-disk-space, this is the point of no return.
 *
 *		6d) If the user does not cancel, DigSig calls XxxxSig.dsCommitSign 
 *			to update the document with the actual signature.
 *			XxxxSig creates the signature dictionary, possibly using 
 *			 information in the signature field /DV dictionary; some 
 *			 portions have dummy values, at least including the /ByteRange 
 *			 and /Contents keys
 *			XxxxSig points /V in the signature field dictionary to this
 *			XxxxSig creates the /AP /N value in the signature annotation 
 *			 dictionary, using a method-specific visible representation of 
 *			 the signature, including a symbol signifying "unvalidated 
 *			 signature" 
 *			XxxxSig may allocate dynamic storage for a marked array
 *			XxxxSig returns an array of "marked" COS objects that it 
 *			 cares about; this array includes at least the /ByteRange and 
 *			 /Contents value objects
 *		7a) DigSig inserts the /Changes array from 6b.
 *		7b) DigSig saves the PDF document to a file. For each Cos object in 
 *			the marked array, DigSig records the objects byte offset and 
 *			length in the file as written. The saved file may have objects 
 *			encrypted by the Acrobat standard encryption handler, if the user 
 *			so chooses.
 *			The very first time a document is signed, this save may rename 
 *			the file and may invoke the Optimizer, Linearizer, and Garbage 
 *			Collector. Upon return from the save, all COS objects are invalid, 
 *			including those in the marked array. Also, all PD-level objects 
 *			except the PDDoc are invalid. Signing methods must not depend on 
 *			saving any such state between dsCommitSign and dsFinishSign. In 
 *			particular, the byte offsets and lengths in the marked array are
 *			valid upon entry to doSign, but the COS objects are not. The order 
 *			of entries is unchanged, however.
 *				[these COS objects will be rewritten by DigSig as 
 *				 CosNull before calling dsFinishSign.]
 *		7c) DigSig calls XxxxSig.dsFinishSign, passing back in the marked array
 *			XxxxSig calculates the /ByteRange that it desires, using the 
 *			 byte offsets and lengths in the marked array.
 *			XxxxSig overwrites the marked /ByteRange value in the saved 
 *			 file, using the DigSigOverwriteIntArray or 
 *			 DigSigOverwriteBytes callback 
 *			XxxxSig overwrites any other marked Cos objects it wants to
 *			XxxxSig calculates any document digest that it desires, using 
 *			 the DigSigFileGetEOF, DigSigFileSetPos, and DigSigFileRead 
 *			 callbacks; or it may use the DigSigMD5ByteRange callback
 *			XxxxSig obscures or encrypts this digest in a method-specific 
 *			 way
 *			XxxxSig overwrites the marked /Contents value in the saved 
 *			 file, using DigSigOverwriteHexstring or DigSigOverwriteBytes
 *			XxxxSig may delete dynamic storage for the marked array
 *			XxxxSig returns
 *		8) DigSig calls XxxxSig.dsFreeSigData, which may free up any
 *			remaining storage 
 *
 * If the user asks to validate one or more signature fields, DigSig sequences 
 * though them one at a time:
 *		9) DigSig calls XxxxSig.validateSign
 *			XxxxSig re-calculates any document digest that it desires, 
 *			 using the DigSigFileGetEOF, DigSigFileSetPos, and 
 *			 DigSigFileRead callbacks; or it may use the DigSigMD5ByteRange 
 *			 callback
 *			XxxxSig compares this result to the stored one, and does any 
 *			 other method-specific checks it desires.
 *			XxxxSig optionally does a validation against some stored 
 *			 (network) registry.
 *			XxxxSig updates the /AP /N value in the signature annotation 
 *			 dictionary to show doublechecked/pass/fail symbol
 *			XxxxSig returns doublechecked/pass/fail
 *
 * The user may open more than one document at a time, and may switch between 
 * open documents at will.
 *
 * The user may ask to show a signature panel containing summary information 
 * for each signature in an open document. If multiple documents are open, 
 * there may be multiple panels, or a single panel may be repainted as the 
 * user switches between documents. DigSig manages updating the panel(s), but 
 * may call the respective method plugin for each signature to get information 
 * to display on the panel. For each signature, the signature panel has two 
 * levels of detail:
 *		10a) CLOSED displays a doublechecked/pass/fail/unknown/blank icon and 
 *			a line of text for each signature field in the document. The 
 *			default text is the name of the person signing and the date and 
 *			time of signing, displayed in a language-independent way. 
 *		  DigSig calls XxxxSig.validState to choose which icon to show
 *
 *		10b) OPEN displays an icon and line of text for each signature, then
 *			indented lines of further text, currently consistingof the name 
 *			of the signer, date and time of signing, location of signing, 
 *			reason for signing, and signing method
 *		  DigSig calls XxxxSig.validState to choose which icon to show
 *
 * A method plugin may wish to asynchronously have the signature panel for 
 * a document updated (it might be doing validation as a background or 
 * idle-loop task). To do this, XxxxSig calls back to DigSigUpdatePanel
 *
 * Eventually, the user closes a document.
 *		11) DigSig calls XxxxSig.docClose()
 *		    DigSig calls YyyySig.docClose()
 * 
 * Whenever a signature is created or verified, the method plugin may 
 * optionally alter the appearance of the signature in the document, for
 * the purpose of displaying or printing. For example, it could change
 * an overprinted question mark on an unverified signature to an underprinted 
 * logo for a verified signature. To help with this, DigSig provides an HFT 
 * callback DigSigGetStdXObj that returns an XObject for for a blank appearance, 
 * a queston mark, or a cross. These are suitable as targets of the Do operator
 * in a signatures appearance stream.
 *
 * To avoid saving a signature to a file with an appearance of valid (rather 
 * than unvalidated), just before each file save DigSig loops through all the 
 * signature fields and calls the specific methods dsUnValidateSig entry. This
 * routine may choose to restore the signatures appearance to the unvalidated
 * state.
 *
 * The purpose of the /Changes array is to pre-calculate at each save whether
 * any changes (other than the signature being applied) have been made to the 
 * document since the prior signature. This allows at subsequent document-open
 * time the quick display of a warning symbol on the Signatures panel if the
 * document was changed between any two signatures. The user may choose to 
 * roll back to the document to just before such a change and study the
 * difference between that document and the final one. This warning was a strong
 * customer request.
 *
 * There is now a constraint on the values in the /ByteRange array. This 
 * constraint allows DigSig to implement rollback to prior signatures:
 *		The largest offset + length value in the /ByteRange array
 *		for a given signature must be equal to the length of the PDF file
 *		containing that signature; i.e. it must equal offset + 1 of the 
 *		"F" in the %%EOF at the end of the file. 
 * In addition, the following constraints are strongly encouraged:
 *		All offsets must be in the range 0..2147483647
 *		All lengths must be in the range 1..2147483647
 *		offset[n+1] must be strictly greater than offset[n] + length[n]
 * 
 * The AcroForms Widget Annot handler calls into DigSig using four entries. 
 * These calls all reflect user actions taken in the document view, not the 
 * Signatures panel view.
 *
 * When the user selects an annotaiton by tabbing to it or by clicking it with 
 * the mouse, and that annotation is for a signature field, AcroForms calls 
 * DigSigDraw. bIsSelected is true if the anotaiton is selected.
 *
 * When the user tabs to a signature annotation and activates it by hitting 
 * the spacebar or enter key, this is equivalent to a left mouse click. 
 * AcroForms calls DigSigKeyDown. The parameters parallel those of 
 * AVAnnotHandlerDoKeyDownProc.
 * 
 * When the user left-clicks inside a signature annotation, AcroForms calls 
 * DigSigClick. The parameters parallel those of DoClickProcType.
 * 
 * When the user right-clicks inside a signature annotation, AcroForms calls 
 * DigSigRightClick.
