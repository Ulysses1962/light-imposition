	page must be added using PDDocCreatePage or PDDocInsertPages 
	before Acrobat can save the document. 

	You can replace this method with your own version, using 
	HFTReplaceEntry. 

	A full save with linearization optimizes the PDF file. During 
	optimization, all objects in a PDF file are rearranged, 
	many of them acquiring not only a new file position, but 
	also a new Cos object number. At the end of the save operation, 
	Acrobat flushes its information of the PD layer and below 
	to synchronize its in-memory state with the new disk file 
	just written. 

	It is crucial that all objects that have been acquired from 
	a PDDoc be released before Acrobat attempts to flush its 
	in-memory state. This includes any object that was acquired 
	with a PD*Acquire method, such as PDDocAcquirePage or PDBeadAcquirePage. 
	Failing to release these objects before the full save results 
	in a save error, and the resulting PDF file is not valid. 
	In addition, all PD level objects and Cos objects derived 
	from the PDDoc are no longer valid after the full save. 
	Attempting to use these objects after a full save produces 
	undefined results. 

	Clients and applications should register for the PDDocWillSaveEx 
	and PDDocDidSave notifications so that they can clean up 
	appropriately. See these notifications for more information 
	on releasing and reacquiring objects from the PDDoc. 
	@param doc The document to save. 
	@param saveFlags A bit field composed of an OR of the

	are used for saveFlags. If PDSaveIncremental is specified 
	in saveFlags, then newPath should be NULL. If PDSaveFull 
	is specified and newPath is the same as the file's original 
	path, the new file is saved to a file system-determined 
	temporary path, then the old file is deleted and the new 
	file is renamed to newPath.
	@param fileSys File system. If NULL, uses the fileSys 
	of the document's current backing file. Files can only be 
	saved to the same file system. fileSys must be either NULL 
	or the default file system obtained with ASGetDefaultFileSys, 
	otherwise an error is raised.

	Inserts numPages pages from doc2 into doc. All annotations, 
	and anything else associated with the page (such as a thumbnail 
	image) are copied from the doc2 pages to the new pages in 
	doc. This method does not insert if doc equals doc2. 

	The insertFlags control whether bookmarks and threads are 
	inserted along with the specified pages. Setting The PDInsertAll 
	flag has two effects:
	
	-  The parameters indicating which pages to insert are
	ignored: all the pages of doc2 are inserted.
	-  In addition to inserting the pages themselves, 
	PDDocInsertPages also merges other document data from doc2 into doc. 
	In particular:	
	 -  Named destinations from doc2 (of PDF 1.1 and later) are 
	copied into doc. If there are named destinations in doc2 
	with the same name as some named destination in doc, the 
	ones in doc retain their names and the copied named destinations 
	are given new names based on the old ones with distinguishing 
	digits added. Actions and bookmarks referring to the old 
	names are made to refer to the new names after being copied 
	into doc.
	 - If it is also the case that mergeAfterThisPage denotes the
	last page of the document, then document metadata is merged, and
	the optional content properties are merged in a more symmetrical
	manner than would otherwise be the case.

	Document logical structure from doc2 is copied into doc.
	If less than the whole of doc2 is being inserted, only those
    structure elements having content on the copied pages, and
	the ancestors of those elements, are copied into the
	logical structure tree of doc.
	The top-level children of the structure tree root of doc2 
	are copied as new top-level children of the structure tree 
	root of doc; a structure tree root is created in doc if 
	there was none before. The role maps of the two structure 
	trees are merged, with name conflicts resolved in favor 
	of the role mappings present in doc. Attribute objects
	having scalar values, or values that are arrays of scalar values, are 
	copied. Class map information from doc2 is also merged 
	into that for doc. 
	@param doc The document into which pages are inserted. 
	This document must have at least one page. 
	@param mergeAfterThisPage The page number in doc after 
	which pages from doc2 are inserted. The first page is 0. 
	If PDBeforeFirstPage (see PDExpT.h) is used, the pages are 
	inserted before the first page in doc. Use PDLastPage to 
	insert pages after the last page in doc.
	@param doc2 The document containing the pages that are 
	inserted into doc. 
	@param startPage The page number of the first page in 
	doc2 to insert into doc. The first page is 0. 
	@param numPages The number of pages in doc2 to insert 
	into doc. Use PDAllPages to insert all pages from doc2 into 
	doc. 
	@param insertFlags Flags that determine what additional 
	information is copied from doc2 into doc. An OR of the following 
	constants (see PDExpT.h):
	
	-  PDInsertBookmarks - Inserts bookmarks as well as pages.
	The bookmark tree of doc2 is merged into the bookmark 
	tree of doc by copying it as a new first-level subtree of 
	doc's bookmark tree root, of which it becomes the last child. 
	If doc has no bookmark tree, it acquires one identical to 
	the bookmark tree from doc2. 
	-  PDInsertThreads - Inserts threads as well as pages.
	-  PDInsertAll - Inserts document data from pages.
	@param progMon A progress monitor. Use AVAppGetDocProgressMonitor 
	to obtain the default progress monitor. NULL may be passed, 
	in which case no progress monitor is used. 
	@param progMonClientData Pointer to user-supplied data 
	to pass to progMon each time it is called. Should be NULL

	provides the sampled image used as the thumbnail image. 
	Pass NULL to use the default server. 
	@param serverClientData IN/OUT? User-supplied data to pass to the 
	thumbnail creation server. 
	@param colorSpace IN/OUT? The color space in which the thumbnail 
	data is represented. It must be DeviceRGB. Thumbnails may 
	be created in either a direct or an indexed color space; 
	however, it is strongly recommended that you use indexed 
	color spaces over direct color spaces. Using direct color 
	spaces with this version of Acrobat may cause bad looking 
	thumbnails. To specify a direct color space, pass 0 for 
	hiVal and NULL for lookupTable. To specify an indexed color 
	space, pass the appropriate values in hiVal and lookupTable. 
	Direct color spaces in Windows are supported in Acrobat 
	3.0. Prior to Acrobat 3.0 in Windows, you had to use indexed 
	color spaces. 
	@param bitsPerComponent IN/OUT? The number of bits per color component 
	in the thumbnail image's data. 8 is the only valid value. 
	
	@param hiVal IN/OUT? Used only for indexed color space; pass 0 
	for direct color spaces, as described in colorSpace. hiVal 
	specifies the highest valid index in lookupTable. Because 
	indices start at 0, the number of entries in lookupTable 
	is hiVal + 1. hiVal must be 0 for device color spaces. 
	@param lookupTable IN/OUT? Used only for indexed color space; pass 
	NULL for direct color spaces, as described in colorSpace. 
	lookupTable is a table that maps data values to colors. 
	Used only for indexed color spaces. Must be NULL for device 
	color spaces. For an indexed color space, the size of the 
	lookup table must be (hiVal + 1):\n
	
	-  sizeof(ASUns8)
	-  3, where the 3 arises because an RGB color space has three 
	color components.

	progMon each time it is called. Should be NULL if progMon 
	is NULL. 
	@param cancelProc IN/OUT? A procedure to call frequently to allow 
	the user to cancel thumbnail creation. Use AVAppGetCancelProc 
	to obtain the default cancel proc for this parameter. May

/**
	Creates a word finder that is used to extract text in the 
	host encoding from a PDF file. The word finder may either 
	be used by PDWordFinderEnumWords (which enumerates words 
	one-by-one) or by PDWordFinderAcquireWordList (which fills 
	a table with all the words on a page). 

	NOTE: The word finder also extracts text from Form XObjects 
	that are executed in the page contents. For information 
	about Form XObjects, see Section 4.9 in the PDF Reference. 
	

	A default ligature table is used, containing the following 
	ligatures: fi, ff, fl, ffi, ffl, ch, cl, ct, ll, ss, fs, 
	st, oe, OE. The glyph name is substituted for the ligature. 
	

	This method also works for non-Roman (CJK or Chinese-Japanese-Korean) 
	viewers. In this case, words are extracted to the host encoding. 
	Users desiring Unicode output must use PDDocCreateWordFinderUCS, 
	which does the extraction for Roman or non-Roman text. 

	The type of PDWordFinder determines the encoding of the 
	string returned by PDWordGetString. For instance, if PDDocCreateWordFinderUCS 
	is used to create the word finder, PDWordGetString returns 
	only Unicode. 

	For CJK viewers, words are stored internally using CID encoding. 
	For more information on CIDFonts and related topics, see 
	Section 5.6 in the PDF Reference. For detailed information 
	on CIDFonts, see Technical Note #5092, CID-Keyed Font Technology 
	Overview, and Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont 
	Files Specification. 
	@param doc The document on which the word finder is used. 
	
	@param outEncInfo Array of 256 flags, specifying the type 
	of character at each position in the encoding. Each flag 
	is an OR of the Character Type Codes. If outEncInfo is NULL, 
	the platform's default encoding info is used. Use outEncInfo 
	and outEncVec together; for every outEncInfo use a corresponding 
	outEncVec to specify the character at that position in the 
	encoding. Regardless of the characters specified in outEncInfo 
	as word separators, a default set of word separators is 
	used (see Glyph Names of Word Separators). There is no way 
	to change the list of characters that are considered to 
	be word separators.
	@param outEncVec Array of 256 null-terminated strings 
	that are the glyph names in encoding order. See the discussion 
	of character names in Section 5.3 of the PostScript Language 
	Reference Manual, Third Edition. If outEncVec is NULL, the 
	platform's default encoding vector is used. For non-UNIX 
	Roman systems, it is MacRomanEncoding in Mac OS and WinAnsiEncoding 
	in Windows. In UNIX (except HP-UX) Roman systems, it is 
	ISO8859-1 (ISO Latin-1); for HP-UX, it is HP-ROMAN8. See 
	Appendix D in the PDF Reference for descriptions of MacRomanEncoding, 
	WinAnsiEncoding, and PDFDocEncoding. Use this parameter 
	with outEncInfo. See outEncInfo for more information. 
	@param ligatureTbl A null-terminated array of null-terminated 
	strings. Each string is the glyph name of a ligature in 
	the font. When a word contains a ligature, the glyph name 
	of the ligature is substituted for the ligature (for example, 
	ff is substituted for the ff ligature). This table must 
	be terminated with NULL. If ligatureTbl is NULL, a default 
	ligature table is used, containing the following ligatures: 
	fi, ff, fl, ffi, ffl, ch, cl, ct, ll, ss, fs, st, oe, OE. 
	
	@param algVersion The version of the word-finding algorithm 
	to use (see PDExpT.h), as follows (pass 0 if your client 
	does not care): WF_LATEST_VERSION  - To obtain latest available 
	version. WF_VERSION_2 - Version used for Acrobat 3.x, 4.x. 
	WF_VERSION_3 - Available in Acrobat 5.0 without Accessibility 
	enabled. Includes some improved word piecing algorithms. 
	WF_VERSION_4 - For Acrobat 5.0 with Accessibility enabled. 
	Includes advanced word ordering algorithms in addition to 
	improved word piecing algorithms. 
	@param rdFlags Word-finding options that determine the 
	tables filled when using PDWordFinderAcquireWordList. Must 
	be an OR of one or more of the WordFinder Sort Order Flags. 
	In Acrobat 5.0 this parameter is ignored and you should 
	pass in NULL.

	Removes leading and trailing spaces and leading and trailing 
	punctuation (including soft hyphens) from the specified 
	word. It does not remove wildcard characters ('*' and '?') 
	or any punctuation surrounded by alphanumeric characters 
	within the word. It also converts ligatures to their constituent 
	characters. 

	The determination of which characters are alphanumeric, 
	wildcard, punctuation, and so forth, is made by the values 
	in infoArray. 

	Although this method seems very similar to PDWordFilterWord, 
	the two methods treat letters and digits slightly differently. 
	PDWordFilterWord uses the encoding info array but also does 
	a straight character code test for any characters that have 
	not been mapped to anything. It does this to catch letters 
	and digits from non-standard character sets, and is necessary 
	to avoid removing words with non-standard character sets. 
	

	PDWordFilterString, on the other hand, was designed for 
	known character sets such as WinAnsi and Mac Roman. 

	For non-Roman character set viewers, this method currently 
	supports only SHIFT-JIS encoding on a Japanese system. 
	@param infoArray An array specifying the type of each 
	character in the font. Each entry in this table must be 
	one of the Character Type Codes. If infoArray is set to 
	NULL, a default table is used. For non-UNIX Roman systems, 
	it is MacRomanEncoding in Mac OS and WinAnsiEncoding in 
	Windows. In UNIX (except HP-UX) Roman systems, it is ISO8859-1 
	(ISO Latin-1); for HP-UX, it is HP-ROMAN8. See Appendix

	It begins reading at the current stream position, and reads

	This is the number of bytes read from the stream and indicates

	-  NULL object returned (of type CosNull) 
	-  Number of bytes read (return value) is 1 
	
	If the token is an integer, real (ASFixed) or ASBool, then 
	the value is returned in pageStmToken.iVal. If the token 
	is a string or a name, the value is returned in pageStmToken.sVal, 
	and the length of the token is in pageStmToken.sValLen. 
	Strings are not null-terminated, but names are null-terminated. 
	If a string length is greater than kPDPageStmStringMax, 
	the PDPageStmStringOverflowProc is called repeatedly with 
	portions of the string. On return from PDPageStmGetToken, 
	the value of pageStmToken.sValLen is zero, and pageStmToken.sVal 
	is empty (ival, sVal and sValLen are components of the PDPageStmToken). 
	If there is no overflow proc, then the first kPDPageStmStringMax 
	bytes of the string will be returned in pageStmToken.sVal, 
	and the remaining bytes are lost. The value of pageStmToken.sValLen 
	is kPDPageStmStringMax in this case. 

	If the token is BI (begin inline image), PDPageStmGetInlineImage 
	should be called to parse the inline image.

/**
	Gets an ASAtom representing Registry and Ordering for a

	PDFontGetCIDSystemInfo takes either a Type 0 font or descendant 
	font (CIDType0 or CIDType2) as an argument. This information 
	is always present for any Type 0 font; the actual registry 
	ordering information is a part of the descendant font. 

	This method provides one way to identify a font's language. 
	

	The CIDSystemInfo entry uses three components to identify 
	a character collection uniquely:\n
	
	-  A registry name to identify an issuer of ordering information. 
	-  An ordering name to identify an ordered character collection. 
	-  A supplement number to indicate that the ordered character 
	collection for a registry, ordering, and previous supplement 
	has been changed to add new characters assigned CIDs beginning 
	with the next available CID. 
	
	The PDFontGetCIDSystemInfo method obtains the first two 
	of these components. 

	A CIDFont is designed to contain a large number of glyph 
	procedures. Instead of being accessed by a name, each glyph 
	procedure is accessed by an integer known as a character 
	identifier or CID. Instead of a font encoding, CIDFonts

	-  A registry name to identify an issuer of orderings. 
	-  An ordering name to identify an ordered character collection.

	collection for a registry, ordering, and previous supplement 
	has been changed to add new characters assigned CIDs beginning

	This method is called each time the Acrobat viewer draws 
	an XObject image, regardless of whether the image XObject 
	has an Alternates key.
	You can replace this method with your own version, using 
	HFTReplaceEntry. 
	@param image The Cos object for this image XObject's base 
	image. Under some circumstances, PDImageSelectAlternate 
	can be called with an XObject type other than an image; 
	for example, a form. Because of this, your code must check 
	the XObject's subtype (you can use CosDictGet to read the 
	value of the XObject's Subtype key). If the subtype is not 
	Image, your code must not modify the XObject, but simply 
	return the CosObj that was passed to you. 
	@param print true if printing, false if displaying. 
	@param tickLimit Amount of time, in ticks, before the 
	image selector must return control to the Acrobat viewer. 
	This parameter is not relevant for image selectors that 
	simply choose an existing alternate or create a new image 
	XObject using Cos methods, but it is relevant for image 
	selectors that create a new image XObject by calculating 
	or reading data from a network or a slow device.
	
	-  If tickLimit is zero, the image selector must not return
	control to the Acrobat viewer until the selector can provide
	the alternate image to use.
	-  If tickLimit is nonzero, the image selector 
	does not have to provide the image XObject within tickLimit, 
	but it must raise the fileErrBytesNotReady exception if 
	it cannot. This returns control to the Acrobat viewer and 
	informs it that the data is not ready. The Acrobat viewer 
	then calls the image selector periodically until the image 
	selector returns the selected image XObject.
	
	@param cacheImageP If true, the image data returned to 
	the Acrobat viewer is cached for future use. If false, it 
	is not. Pass true if you expect your image data to remain 
	valid for at least several calls to your client. Pass false 
	if you expect your image data to change on the next call 
	to your client. If you create and return a Cos stream object 
	with an external file system and the stream's data will 
	not always be the same, you must set cacheImageP to false. 
	If you fail to do this, the Acrobat viewer may use cached 
	image data when it should not. 
	@param callData An opaque pointer containing data that 
	must be passed in other image selector calls.
	@return The image XObject to use. Returning a NULL Cos object (obtained 
	using CosNewNull) tells the Acrobat viewer to skip this 
	XObject entirely.

	information for the image selector plug-in to determine

	You can use version 6.0 methods such as PDWordGetCharOffsetEx

/**
	This is a version 6.0 extension of PDWordGetCharOffset that 
	can be used only with a word finder created with algorithm 
	version WF_VERSION_3 or higher. 

	Returns the character offset for a character identified 
	by its index number, and the number of bytes (length) used 
	for that character. The length is usually 1 for single-byte 
	characters and 2 for double-byte characters. If multiple 
	bytes are used to construct one character, only the first 
	byte has valid character offset information and the other 
	bytes have zero offset length with the same character offset 
	of the first byte. If the returned offset length is zero, 
	it means the specified byte in the word is a part (other 
	than the first byte) of a multi-byte character. 

	The character offset is the character position calculated 
	in bytes from the beginning of a page. Because of the encoding 
	conversions and character replacements applied by the word 
	finder, some characters may have different byte lengths 
	from the original PDF content. The character offset itself 
	can locate a character in the PDF content. However, without 
	the offset length (that is the number of bytes in the PDF 
	content), clients cannot tell whether two characters are 
	next to each other in the PDF content or not. For example, 
	suppose you want to create a Text Select object of two characters 
	at character offset 1 and 3. You can create an object with 
	two disconnected ranges of [Offset 1, Length 1] and [Offset 
	3, Length 1]. However, if you know that the offset length 
	of both characters is 2, you can create a simpler object 
	with a single range of [Offset 1, Length 4]. 
	@param word The word whose character offset is obtained. 
	
	@param byteIdx The byte index within the word of the character 
	whose offset is obtained. Valid values are 0 to PDWordGetLength(word)-1. 
	@param bytesConsumed (Filled by method) Returns the number 
	of bytes in the word that are occupied by the specified 
	character. Can be NULL if not needed. Use (byteIdx + *bytesConsumed) 
	to get the byte index of the next character in the word. 
	
	@param offsetLen (Filled by the method) Returns the number 
	of bytes occupied by the specified character in the original 
	PDF content. This is 0 if the specified byte is not the

	NULL if not needed.

	Call this method at the start of an enumeration or drawing 
	operation that uses a given context. 

	The OCMD stack contains optional-content membership dictionary 
	objects. The OCMD stack methods and the various methods 
	that test visibility (such as PDAnnotIsCurrentlyVisible) 
	work together as content is being enumerated or drawn to 
	determine whether particular graphical elements are visible 
	or not. Visibility is based on the context's collection 
	of ON-OFF states for optional-content groups, the context's 
	current settings for NonOCDrawing and PDOCDrawEnumType, 
	and the state of the OCMD stack. 

	Any custom drawing or enumerating code that needs to keep 
	track of visibility of content must make a private copy 
	of the PDOCContext if that context could be accessed by 
	some other client, in order to avoid conflicting state changes. 
	In particular, you must copy the document's default context 
	(as returned by PDDocGetOCContext). To enforce this, this 
	reset method does nothing when given a document's default 
	context. Similarly, the push and pop stack operations raise 
	an error for the default context. 

	If you are using the PD-level draw and enumeration methods, 
	you do not need to copy the context or explicitly call the 
	OCMD stack methods, as the PD-level methods do this internally. 
	

	Clients of PDFEdit and other libraries that enumerate contents 
	need to use these three methods when traversing the PDEContent 
	structure. When entering a new PDEContent, call PDOCContextPushOCMD
