/**
	This notification is broadcast before a document is printed, 
	before any marks are made on the first page. When printing 
	to a PostScript printer, printing commands can also be sent 
	that are placed on the page before any other marks. For 
	example, a setpagedevice operator could be placed in the 
	print stream. 

	NOTE: Page resources and contents cannot be modified reliably 
	at the time this notification is broadcast. 
	@param doc The document that is about to be printed. 
	@param stm The PostScript print stream when printing to 
	a PostScript printer, and NULL when printing to a non-PostScript 
	printer. When printing to a PostScript printer, clients 
	can write printing commands into stm (using ASStmWrite) 
	to add marks to pages before any other marks have been made. 
	In the 2.x Acrobat viewers, the page printing sequence to 
	a PostScript printer is:\n
	page setup (including setpagedevice) ... save ...\n
	gsave ... save ... begin ... begin ... begin ... PDDocWillPrintPage ... page\n
	contents ... PDDocDidPrintPage ... end ... end ... end ... restore ... restore ...\n
	showpage.\n
	This sequence must not be relied on, and it is 
	to some extent dependent on the printer driver in use. Nevertheless, 
	it is true that by the time the PDDocWillPrintPage notification 
	is broadcast, it is too late to perform any setpagedevice 
	operations. 
	@param psLevel When printing to a PostScript printer, 
	psLevel is either 1 or 2, representing the PostScript level 
	available on the printer. When printing to a non-PostScript 
	printer, psLevel is 0. psLevel is useful in determining 
	whether the output device is a PostScript printer. In addition, 
	when printing to a PostScript printer, psLevel is useful 
	to determine the operators that can be sent in any printing 
	code downloaded using the PDDocWillPrintDoc, PDDocWillPrintPage, 
	and PDDocDidPrintPage notifications.
